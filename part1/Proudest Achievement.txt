At the early stages of my career, i was learning a lot of things and cloud technology was completely new to me. 
I had an interest and started learning and i did internship related to CI/CD 
I felt like i cannot do it at the beginning but as i was curious I focused and worked on it. 
I analyzed my daily work weekly and finally got the results. Later i felt proud of myself.
In recent time i done projects on aws like recoverability in aws and also udacity capstone project i.e. creating a CI/CD pipeline for a basic website that deploys to a cluster in AWS EKS which is Blue/Green Deployment which helps me to learn new things.
at last i experienced many challanges like how to meet deadlines,teamwork,how to handle the pressure situations and how to troubleshoot the issues etc.
